# Automation Testing Project ReadMe

## Introduction
This ReadMe file provides an overview of the automation testing project implemented using C#, Playwright, and SpecFlow. It includes information about the project setup, dependencies, test execution, and other relevant details. 

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard structure with separate directories for different components:

- **Features**: Contains SpecFlow feature files written in Gherkin syntax that define the test scenarios.
- **StepDefinitions**: Contains the implementation of step definitions for the SpecFlow scenarios.
- **PageObjects**: Contains the Page Object Model (POM) classes that represent the web pages and their associated methods.
- **Utilities**: Contains utility classes or methods that provide common functionality or reusable code snippets.
- **Tests**: Contains the test classes that define and execute the automated tests.

## Setup
To set up the automation testing project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from the specified location.
2. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. This includes:
    - .NET Core SDK
    - Playwright for .NET
    - SpecFlow for .NET
3. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
4. Build the project to restore NuGet packages and compile the solution.

## Configuration
Before running the tests, ensure that the project is properly configured. Open the `appsettings.json` file in the project root and update the following configuration parameters:

- **BaseUrl**: Set the base URL of the application or website under test.
- **BrowserType**: Specify the browser type to be used for testing (e.g., chromium, firefox, webkit).

## Writing Tests
The tests in this project are written using the SpecFlow framework, which follows the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach. Each test scenario is defined in a feature file using Gherkin syntax.

To create a new test, follow these steps:

1. Create a new feature file under the **Features** directory.
2. Define the test scenario using Given-When-Then steps in the Gherkin syntax.
3. Save the feature file.

## Running Tests
To execute the automated tests, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to execute the tests:
```
dotnet test
```
4. The tests will run, and the test execution results will be displayed in the terminal.

## Extending and Customizing
This project serves as a starting point for your automation testing efforts. You can extend and customize it based on your requirements. Some possible enhancements include:

- Adding more feature files to cover additional test scenarios.
- Implementing additional utility methods or helper classes.
- Integrating the project with a continuous integration (CI) system for automated test execution.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while setting up or running the project, try the following troubleshooting steps:

- Ensure that all the required dependencies are properly installed.
- Check the configuration settings in the `appsettings.json` file.
- Verify that the test scenarios are correctly defined in the feature files.
- Refer to the documentation of the respective tools (C#, Playwright, SpecFlow) for additional assistance.

## Conclusion
This automation testing project provides a foundation for writing and executing automated tests using C#, Playwright, and SpecFlow. By following the instructions in this ReadMe file, you can set up the project, write tests, and run them efficiently. Feel free to explore and customize the project to suit your specific testing needs. Happy testing!
